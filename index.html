      <p><b>I'm a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics">School of Maths at the University of Edinburgh</a>, in Scotland.</b>
      I am funded in part through the <a href="https://scgcs.berkeley.edu/">Simons Collaboration on Global Categorical Symmetries</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      My research is mainly focused on using skein theory to understand (quantised) constructions in algebraic geometry and (again, quantum) non-semisimple topological invariants.
      These fall into a branch of math often called quantum topology.
      I also enjoy coding, you can find some of my old and ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/jmhbrown">my github profile</a>.
      </p>
      <p>In June 2022 I was awarded a PhD in Mathematics at UC Davis, working with <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mulase/">Motohico Mulase</a> and <a href="https://www.dimoftelab.com/home">Tudor Dimofte</a>.
      My bachelors degree is in both math and physics and from Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. <a href="https://science.psu.edu/physics/people/marcos-rigol">Marcos Rigol</a> was my senior thesis adviser. Between degrees I worked for a couple years as a systems and infrastructure engineer at a tech company. (The company has since been acquired by Oracle.)</p>
      <p>During graduate school I was a wilderness guide for the <a href="https://campusrecreation.ucdavis.edu/outdoor-adventures">Outdoor Adventure</a> program at Davis.</p>
