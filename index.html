      <p><b>I'm a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics">School of Maths at the University of Edinburgh</a>, in Scotland.</b>
      My research is mainly focused on skein theories, cluster coordinates, and quantization.
      These fall into a branch of math often called quantum topology.
      </p>
      <p>In June 2022 I was awarded a PhD in Mathematics at UC Davis, working with <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mulase/">Motohico Mulase</a> and <a href="https://www.dimoftelab.com/home">Tudor Dimofte</a>.
      My bachelors degree is in both math and physics and from Georgetown University, in Washington, DC. <a href="https://science.psu.edu/physics/people/marcos-rigol">Marcos Rigol</a> was my senior thesis adviser. Between degrees I worked for a couple years as a systems and infrastructure engineer at a tech company. (The company has since been acquired by Oracle.)</p>
      <p>During graduate school I was a wilderness guide for the <a href="https://cru.ucdavis.edu/outdooradventures">Outdoor Adventure</a> program at Davis.</p>
